# ==============================================================================
# Docker Build Workflow — builds and pushes container images for services.
#
# WHY: Every service needs a container image for deployment to ECS/Fargate.
# This workflow builds multi-stage Docker images, tags them with the commit SHA
# and branch name, and pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).
#
# WHEN: Runs on push to main. Individual services are built only when their
# source files change (detected via dorny/paths-filter). This avoids
# rebuilding all images on every commit.
#
# NOTE: This workflow uses a matrix strategy for future services. Currently
# no services are implemented (only shared libraries). The matrix will be
# populated as domain services are built in subsequent epics. The workflow
# structure is ready for when services come online.
#
# Reinterpretation of US-01-07 AC7 for Java 21 + Maven (original was Node.js).
