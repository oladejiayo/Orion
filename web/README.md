# Web Applications

React + TypeScript frontend applications. These are **not** Maven modules — they use Vite/npm for build.

## Planned Applications

| App | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `workstation` | Main trading workstation SPA (Market Watch, RFQ Ticket, Blotters, Analytics) |
| `admin-console` | Admin UI for reference data, user management, and system configuration |

## Build

```bash
cd web/workstation
npm install
npm run dev      # Development server
npm run build    # Production build
npm test         # Run tests
```
